5th Assignment (23 Aug,2021)

1.WAP to swap kth node from beginning with kth node from end in a Linked List

2.Given a linked list, write a function to reverse every k nodes. (where k is
an input to the function). If a linked list is given as
12->23->45->89->15->67->28->98->NULL and k = 3
then output will be
45->23->12->67->15->89->98->28->NULL.

3.Given a singly linked list, rotate the linked list counter-clockwise by k nodes.
 Where k is a given positive integer. For example, if the given linked list 
is 10->20->30->40->50->60 and k is 4, the list should be modified 
to 50->60->10->20->30->40. Assume that k is smaller than the count of nodes in linked list.

4. WAP to insert a new node at the beginning of a doubly linked list.

5. WAP to delete a node after a certain node of a single circular linked list.

6. WAP to insert a new node at the beginning of a single circular linked list.

7.WAP to remove the duplicates in a sorted double linked list.

8. WAP to check whethere a doubly llinked list is palindrome or not.
